My academic journey commenced with my success in the demanding national exam, JEE Advanced. This achievement paved the way for me to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in Chemistry at the esteemed Indian Institute of Science Education and Research-Thiruvananthapuram (IISER-TVM), India. Currently, I am immersed in doctoral studies as a PhD student at the University of the Basque Country in Spain. Current work is focused on New Excited State Wavefunction Methods for Optoelectronics.
