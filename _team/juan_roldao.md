My research activity focuses
on the theoretical treatment of photophysical properties and processes of
organic complexes at the molecular and supramolecular scales using quantum
chemistry methods at different theory levels for optoelectronic applications.

I graduated in Physics
(UNESP-Bauru, Brazil). I completed a PhD in Physics in 2022 (UAM-Madrid, Spain)
investigating photophysical properties and processes of charge-transfer
complexes and small to medium sizes conjugated compounds under the supervision of
Dr. Johannes Gierschner.

Since June of 2022, I have
been part of a project with Dr. David Casanova (DIPC, Spain), Dr. Henrik
Ottosson (Uppsala University, Sweden), and Dr. Frederic Castet (University of
Bordeaus, France) groups. This project is devoted to the theoretical study of
organic compounds with potential application in optoelectronics.
