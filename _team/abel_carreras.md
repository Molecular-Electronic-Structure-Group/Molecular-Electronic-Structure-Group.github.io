I was born in 1983 in Berga and studied chemistry at the University of Barcelona. 
I joined the Electronic Structure Group in 2007 where I presented a PhD thesis on 
the dynamics of molecular gears under the supervision of Dr. M. Llunell and Prof. P. Alemany.
From 2014 to 2018 I carried out a postdoctoral research in the group of Prof. Isao Tanaka at the Department of Materials Science 
and Engineering, Kyoto University. During that time I analyzed the phonon 
anharmonicity of crystals using molecular dynamics simulations.
I am currently working in the group of Dr. David Casanova at DIPC 
studying exciton transport on molecular aggregates.
