I was born in 1983 in Berga and studied chemistry at the University of Barcelona. 
I joined the Electronic Structure Group in 2007 where I presented a PhD thesis on 
the dynamics of molecular gears under the supervision of Dr. M. Llunell and Prof. P. Alemany.

From 2014 to 2018 I carried out a postdoctoral research in the group of Prof. Isao Tanaka 
at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Kyoto University. 
During that time I studied the phonon anharmonicity of crystals using molecular 
dynamics simulations.

At the present time I am working at DIPC developing tools to analyze 
 electronic structure of molecules and study exciton transport on 
 molecular aggregates.

I love developing scientific codes and create new tools to automatize
complex tasks using simple interfaces. My research interest revolve around 
the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and computer science.
