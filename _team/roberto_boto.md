My research activity develops on the interface between chemistry, physics and material science. Employing quantum chemistry methods, I address the description of chemical bonding in challenging chemical systems, complex photochemical processes, and the interaction of molecular systems with strong electromagnetic fields.

After finishing my bachelor's degree in chemistry in 2011 at the University of Oviedo (Spain) and defending my Master's Thesis at the same university, I moved to Paris to start my doctoral research at Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Sorbonne Université under the supervision of Dr. Julia Contreras-García. I conducted my Ph.D. research on the analysis of non-covalent interactions using electron density analysis. I became a Doctor in 2016. 

Right away finishing my Ph.D. I was hired as a postdoc at CICECO: Aveiro Institute of Material (Portugal) to work with Dr. Manuel Melle-Franco on chemical bonding, magnetic properties, and excited states of nanoscale graphene fragments. In 2019, I joined The Theory of NanoPhotonics Group at Material Physics Center (Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain) to work with Prof. Javier Aizpurua, Dr. Rubén Esteban, and Dr. David Casanova on the interaction of electronic and vibrational states of matter with light.

Since March 2022, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Molecular Electronic Structure Group led by Dr. David Casanova at Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC, Donostia-San Sebastián). My current scientific project is devoted to the identification and the design of materials with appealing properties for quantum computing.
