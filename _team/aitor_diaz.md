I am currently a PhD student at the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC). 
My PhD research aims to study the exciton dynamics in organic solids and the time evolution of interacting excitons 
from the most simple crystal structure to more complex amorphous systems. 
After I obtained a Degree in Chemistry (UPV/EHU), 
I graduated in the European Master in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling (Spain). 
In the thesis I studied the aromaticity of benzene excimer and excited multimers which we published in 2021. 
Besides the PhD studies I am strongly interested in developing highly parallelized scientific codes. 
I am interested in implementing the power of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) to scientific tools.
