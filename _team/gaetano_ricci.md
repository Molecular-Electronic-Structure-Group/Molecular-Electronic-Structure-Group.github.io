I received my Bachelor's degree (2017) and Master's degree (2019) from the University of
Bologna (Italy), where I conducted my thesis project in computational chemistry under the
supervision of Professor Fabrizia Negri. In 2020, I moved to the University of Namur
(Belgium) to join the group of Professor Yoann Olivier. After nine months as a research
assistant, I began my Ph.D. studies within the same group. My research focused on
exploring the electronic structure and photophysical properties of Multi-Resonant
Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (MR-TADF) and Inverted Singlet-Triplet
(INVEST) systems. I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis in 2024.
Since January 2025, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Molecular Electronic Structure
Group at the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC). My current research focuses
on exploring the interaction between photons and electronic spins in organic materials.
