My research activity focuses on the study of the photophysics of organic (functional) systems at the molecular and supramolecular scales using quantum and classical simulations.

I graduated in Chemistry (France) and then completed a PhD in Physical Chemistry in 2013 at UMONS (Belgium) investigating molecular electronic processes at stake in cation detection by organic dyes. 

In 2014, I moved to the experimental group of P. L. Burn (UQ, Australia) where I investigated the structural and dynamical properties of the amorphous emissive layer of OLEDs using MD simulations.

Before joining DIPC, I worked from 2016 to 2019 at the Institute for Molecular Sciences of the University of Bordeaux where my research principally focused on investigating the structure-property relationships of functional organic systems including a photoresponsive component.
