I'm currently Ikerbasque Research Associate at the Donostia International Physics Center (DICP). 
My research focuses on the development and implementation of electronic structure for excited states 
and strongly correlated systems. I'm also interested in using these methods to study optoelectronic and magnetic 
properties of molecular materials and to investigate underlying photophysical processes. 
I hold a master degree in Chemistry (U. Girona) and in Physics (U. Barcelona). After my PhD studies in Chemistry, 
I joined Prof. Head-Gordon’s group at the UC Berkeley as a Fulbright Research Fellow. In 2009 I received a Ramón y 
Cajal Fellowship (U. Complutense Madrid and U. Barcelona) and in 2013 I became Ikerbasque Research Fellow at the 
U. Basque Country. Since 2018 I'm Research Associate at the DIPC.
