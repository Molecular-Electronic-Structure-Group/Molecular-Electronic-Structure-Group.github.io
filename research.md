# Research

Our research aims to develop new electronic structure models to tackle the study of electronic states of molecules.
We apply these methodologies to the study of interesting photophysical processes with potential novel applications 
in solar energy photoelectric conversion, lighting technologies and in those applications based on the absorption and/or 
emission of light by molecular systems.
