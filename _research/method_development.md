Development and implementation of novel quantum chemistry models for the computation of 
ground and excited states in molecular systems

## Electronic structure methods 

We intend to develope and implement theoretical approaches with small or moderate computational cost able to 
account for electron correlations in the ground and excited states of medium and large molecules. The main goal is to 
provide a good and detailed description of the nature of electronic wave functions (strong correlation) including weak 
electron correlation effects for the precise computation of relative energies and properties. 

## Characterization of electronic states

We also elaborate new computational tools for the analysis and characterization of excited states related to the photophysical 
properties in aggregates. The detailed characterization of the ground and excited states is fundamental in order to 
understand the photophysics in aggregates, in particular for those processes not observed for the corresponding 
molecular species. We aim to define simple indicators based on the electronic structure to measure the properties of 
the low-lying excited states as well as the electronic transitions from the ground state.
