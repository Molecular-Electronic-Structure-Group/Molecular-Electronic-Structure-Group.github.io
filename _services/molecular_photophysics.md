The group has an extended experience in the application of electronic structure methods (either developed in the group 
or available in quantum chemistry packages) for the study of the ground and excited states of molecules, their properties 
and the photophysical and/or photochemical processes in which they might be involved.

This line of research is not only focused on the study of electronic transitions in individual molecules, 
but also in the presence of multiple molecular species in which cooperative intermolecular interactions tune the 
distribution of electronic states and modify their nature with respect to their constituents, such as in covalent dimers 
and oligomers, and in molecular aggregates.
