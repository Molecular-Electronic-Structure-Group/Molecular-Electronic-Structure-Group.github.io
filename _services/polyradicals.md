We are very interested in the characterization of radicals, diradicaloild and multiradicaloid molecular species,
that is molecules with unpaired electrons.
We aim to rationalize the origin of the open-shell character of organic molecules and to predict novel properties 
derived from it, e.g., optical, electronic or magnetic.
